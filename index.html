<h2>What is AmericanValues?</h2>
    <p>AmericanValues is a political test that aims to place you on 8 different axes, based on current US politics. You don't have to be American to take, and relate to the test. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2>What are the sixteen values?</h2>
    <p>There are eight independent axes - The 2 Parties, Party System, Progress, progtitution, International, Government Size, Civil War, and Election System - and each has two opposing values assigned to them. They are:</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#1668FF;">Democrat</b> (The 2 Parties)<br/>
        Those with higher Democrat scores support/sympathize with the Democratic party. They are usually more socially left-wing and believe in a bigger government.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#FF3826;">Republican</b> (The 2 Parties)<br/>
        Those with higher Republican scores support/sympathize with the Republican party. They are usually more socially right-wing, believe in smaller government, and nationalistic.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#A55FB1;">2 Party</b> (Party System)<br/>
        Those with higher 2 Party scores tend to support and believe in the current 2 Party system in the USA. They believe people should have 2 major choices, and that the media should highlight those two. They are usually very anti-third party, and progider anything outside the status-quo as unrealistic.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#8BC34A;">Multi Party</b> (Party System)<br/>
        Those with higher Multi Party scores tend to dislike the current 2 Party system, and believe that people should have a larger array of choices for political candidates. They believe that the media shouldn't be biased towards one of the two parties, and tend to dislike that debates are only held with 2 parties.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#7F7D0E;">Liberal</b> (Progress)<br/>
        Those with higher Liberal scores have a very socially progressive school of thought. They usually support social justice, LGBT, Black Lives Matter, etc. They tend to dislike nationalism, and support globalism.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#42AAFF;">Conservative</b> (Progress)<br/>
        Those with higher Conservative scores have a very socially traditional school of thought. They usually dislike organizations like BLM, and oppose social justice. They have a very high chance of following some religion/moral system.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#268E4E;">Constitutional</b> (Constitution)<br/>
        Those with higher Constitutional scores believe that the US progtitution should remain as it is, and have as little amendments and change brought upon it. They are usually very strong advocates of free speech, gun rights, jury, etc.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#BA1B1D;">Amendment</b> (Constitution)<br/>
        Those with higher Amendment scores believe that the Constitution is a piece of outdated law the should be frequently changed, or even fully repealed. They usually advocate for stricter gun laws, the patriot act, and other "unconsitutional" laws.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#DB8F26;">Patriot</b> (International)<br/>
        Those with higher Patriot scores believe that America should favor itself and its citizens over other nations. They tend to dislike organizations like NATO, and strongly oppose deployment to the middle east and other nations.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#012169;">Globalist</b> (International)<br/>
        Those with higher Globalist scores believe that America should stick to, and support its allies unconditionally. They tend to support organizations like NATO, support toppling of illegitimate regimes, and look favorably to the middle eastern deployment.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#FFFFFF;">Big Government</b> (Government Size)<br/>
	  Those with higher Big Government scores believe that the government should expand its reach and power within the US. They sometimes believe the government should influence the people and intervene in day-to-day life. They are usually Left-Wing.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#FFEB3B;">Small Government</b> (Government Size)<br/>
	  Those with higher Small Government scores believe that the government should limit itself as much as possible. They believe the government has no place intervening in citizens day-to-day life. They are usually Right-Wing.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#218094;">Union</b> (Civil War)<br/>
	  Those with higher Union sympathized with the Union during the civil war. They think of the Confederacy as a racist slave-ran seccessionist movement that had no right to exist. They usually support the modern Union, centralization of law, and abhore the idea of states seceding.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#CC0033;">Confederacy</b> (Government Size)<br/>
	  *It is important to note that people with this score don't necessarily believe in slavery* Those with higher Confederacy scores usually don't think so harshly of the Confederacy. They believe in higher state autonomy, decentralization, and support seccession rights.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#9A9A66;">Electoral College</b> (Election System)<br/>
	  Those with higher Electoral College scores support the current election system of the electoral college. They believe it is the fairest system, and most accurately represents the peoples opinions.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#FFFFAD;">Popular Vote</b> (Election System)<br/>
	  Those with higher Popular Vote scores tend to dislike the status quo of the Electoral College system. They believe it is unfair, and doesn't represent the peoples opinions accurately. They believe the President should be elected purely on how many people voted for him.</p>
<h2>What's the "Closest Match" mean at the bottom of the results?</h2>
        <p>In addition to matching you to the sixteen values, the quiz also attempts to match you to a political viewpoint. This is a work in progress and is much less accurate than the values and axes, so don't take it too seriously. If you disagree with your assigned ideology, send me a message at Mr. Fish#6394, u/DatGuard or our Email at AmericanValuesTest@gmail.com with your scores, matched ideology, and preferred ideology, and I'll look into adjusting the system. Thanks!</p>
<h2>I don't like my scores!</h2>
